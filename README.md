# Dynamic-Malware-Analysis-using-ML-Algorithms-CS658A

Malware analysis is a process of analyzing executables and detecting potential malicious software. A new
family of malware has emerged with advanced evasion, making them much more challenging to use conventional
methods. Malware detection is an essential factor in the computer systemâ€™s security; however,
currently utilized signature-based methods cannot accurately detect zero-day attacks and polymorphic
viruses.
Cuckoo sandbox is used for generating analytic reports of portable executable files by executing them
in a virtual environment. Classified windows PE files are collected from C3I center IIT, Kanpur which
are executed in the sandbox. A parser is built for extracting behavioral features from analytical reports
generated by the cuckoo sandbox. Different Machine learning models such as KNN, Decision Tree, multiclass
SVM, random forest, and DNN were implemented for the classification of PE files and achieved
the highest accuracy with DNN. All related codes are uploaded here.
