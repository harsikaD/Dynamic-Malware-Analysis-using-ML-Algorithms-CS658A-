1.Cuckoo sandbox generate analytic report in JSON format.

These files should be placed according to their labels in folders given in "Generate-Data" folder.


2. Run Parser:

Open terminal in "Generate-Data" folder and run command:

python3 json-parser.py
or
python json-parser.py

It will generate a CSV file named "final-data.csv".


3. Model Training and Testing:

Copy file "final-data.csv" from "Generate-Data" folder to "models" folder.

To execute models KNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest run "malware_models.ipynb" file as jupyter notebook.

To execute DNN model run "DNN.ipynb" file as jupyter notebook.


4. Test a file:

Copy analytic report generated by cuckoo sandbox in "models" folder.

Execute "final-predictor.py" file in terminal using command:

python3 final-predictor.py
or
python final-predictor.py

It will give you the final prediction.
